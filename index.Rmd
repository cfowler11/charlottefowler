I am a doctoral candidate in Biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am completing my  dissertation titled Causal inference and time series methods for N-of-1 mobile health studies with missing data, under [Linda Valeri](https://www.lindavaleri.com/). Here is my [CV](docs_to_link/cfowler_cv.pdf).

### Research Interests

<font size = "4"> 

My research aims to develop statistical methods to conduct causal inference with complex data. I am particularly interested in studying the implications of missing data, unobserved confounding, and latent variables on estimation and inference. My work is motivated by applications to mobile health studies for individuals with severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
