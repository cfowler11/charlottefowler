I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I'm interested in causal inference methods for complex health data, addressing health disparities, and increasing accessibility and diversity in the field of statistics.

I completed my B.A. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Macalester College and PhD in Biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My  dissertation, advised by [Linda Valeri](https://www.lindavaleri.com/), focused on causal inference and time series methods for N-of-1 mobile health studies with missing data. Here is my [CV](docs_to_link/cfowler_cv.pdf).

### Research Interests

<font size = "4"> 

My research aims to develop statistical methods to conduct causal inference with complex data. I am particularly interested in studying the implications of missing data, unobserved confounding, and latent variables on estimation and inference. My work is motivated by applications to mobile health studies for individuals with severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
